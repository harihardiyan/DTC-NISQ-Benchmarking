# DTC-NISQ-Benchmarking (Mark 8): AIC-Driven Model Selection & Monotonicity Audit

## Abstract
**Mark 8** introduces a rigorous statistical decision engine to the DTC stability framework. By implementing the **Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)**, the system objectively selects between standard exponential and stretched exponential models, ensuring the most parsimonious physical representation. Additionally, a **Monotonicity Audit** is introduced to validate the causality of noise-induced decay, reaching a high-fidelity state suitable for professional peer review.

## Key Upgrades in Mark 8
1. **Automated Model Selection (AIC):** Uses $AIC = N \ln(MSE) + 2k$ to penalize overfitting. The system only adopts the 4-parameter *Stretched Exponential* model if the gain in accuracy justifies the complexity over the 3-parameter *Standard Exponential*.
2. **Causality Validation (Monotonicity Check):** Computes the fraction of monotonic decrease in $\tau$ relative to noise increase. A score of $1.00$ confirms that the numerical engine respects the physical law of entropy: higher noise must result in shorter lifetimes.
3. **Structured Configuration:** Migration to `@dataclass` architecture for robust parameter management and improved audit traceability.
4. **Expanded Envelope Metrics:** Inclusion of `envelope_first` and `envelope_last` in the ledger to facilitate remote audit of the decay ratio without re-executing simulations.

## Methodology & Model
The system extracted DTC lifetimes ($\tau$) by evaluating the stroboscopic staggered magnetization $|M(t)|$.

**Optimization Objective:**
$$AIC = n \cdot \ln\left(\frac{\sum (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}{n}\right) + 2k$$
*Where $k$ is the number of parameters ($3$ for exp, $4$ for stretched).*

## Empirical Audit Results (Batch 20250101)
Execution on 12 noise points ($P_1 \in [10^{-4}, 10^{-2}]$) yielded:

| Noise $P_1$ | Lifetime $\tau$ | Model Selected | AIC | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0.00010 | 1551.812 | **Exponential** | -370.89 | GREEN |
| 0.00123 | 118.805 | **Stretched** ($\beta=1.1$) | -363.91 | GREEN |
| 0.01000 | 17.566 | **Stretched** ($\beta=1.05$) | -353.62 | RED |

### Final Audit Ledger
- **Log-log Slope:** `-0.965` (Matches theoretical $P^{-1}$ within 3.5% deviation).
- **Stretched Fraction:** `0.75` (75% of points required non-linear relaxation models).
- **$\tau$ Monotonicity:** `1.00` (**PERFECT CAUSALITY:** Lifetime decreased at every noise increase point).
- **Quantumness Status:** `Coherent Regime` (Avg. Purity: 0.5972).
- **Status:** `OK (Anti-cheat checks passed)`.

## Interpretation
The Mark 8 data confirms that for very low noise regimes, the DTC decay is quasi-standard exponential. However, as noise increases, the system transitions into a **Compressed Exponential regime** ($\beta > 1$), indicating accelerated heating under Floquet driving. The slope of -0.965 validates that Many-Body Localization (MBL) provides significant, but finite, protection against environment-induced ergodicity.
